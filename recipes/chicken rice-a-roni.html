        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Made with shredded chicken, tender basmati rice, and smoky-sweet,
             caramelized onions and peppers, this chicken rice-a-roni was 
             inspired by a Lebanese rice and vermicelli pilaf. Garnish with 
             fresh herbs, lemon juice, chili flakes, hot sauce, or even garlic-infused yogurt! </p>

            <li>1 1/2 cups basmati rice </li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano </li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin </li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon saffron threads, crushed (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper </li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Place chicken, celery, carrot, onion, and bay leaf in a stockpot 
                and cover with water. Set over high heat, add salt, and bring to a simmer.
                Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the thighs and legs can be pulled
                easily from the carcass, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Remove chicken to a bowl,
                carefully tipping the carcass to drain any broth from the cavity back into the stockpot.</p></li>
            <li><p>Let meat sit until it's cool enough to handle, 15 to 20 minutes. Separate skin, bones,
                and meat.Set aside 2 cups shredded meat (white, dark, or a combination of the two) for rice-a-roni 
                and reserve the rest for another use.</p></li>
            <li><p>Transfer skin and bones back to the stockpot with the broth and simmer for 1 to 2 hours or until 
                you need it. Strain.</p></li>
            <li><p>Combine oil and butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. When hot and melted, add onion, bell pepper,
                and salt. Cook and stir until onion just starts to turn translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. 
                Add broken spaghetti and cook until toasted and light golden brown to dark brown in color, 
                about 3 minutes; it's okay if the onions and peppers start to caramelize.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add rice and stir until completely coated. Add pepper, oregano, cumin, and saffron. Stir in 3 1/2 cups chicken broth. 
                Add cayenne, garbanzo beans, peas, and shredded chicken and return to a simmer.</p></li>
            <li><p>Cover tightly with a lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook for 15 minutes; 
                do not lift the lid or stir during this time.</p></li>
            <li><p>Remove the lid and check the rice in a couple spots. It should be just barely tender. 
                (If it seems undercooked, you can cover and cook for a few more minutes.) 
                Replace the lid, turn off the heat, and let rice sit for 10 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Sprinkle parsley and cilantro over top and stir to combine. 
                Check for seasoning and serve immediately.</p></li>
        </ol>
